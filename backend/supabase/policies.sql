-- ==========================================================================
-- NOTES FOR IMPLEMENTATION
-- ==========================================================================

-- 1. These policies assume Supabase Auth is being used
-- 2. The get_current_user_id() function relies on auth.uid()
-- 3. Admin privileges are based on subscription_plan
-- 4. Real-time subscriptions are enabled for game-critical tables
-- 5. All policies follow the principle of least privilege
-- 6. Analytics events have rate limiting to prevent abuse
-- 7. Audit logging is implemented for sensitive operations
-- 8. Anonymous analytics are allowed for non-authenticated users
